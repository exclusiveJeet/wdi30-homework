            <h3>Synopsis</h3>
            <p>Born in New York City in 1906, Grace Hopper joined the U.S. Navy during World War II and was assigned to
              program the Mark I computer. She continued to work in computing after the war, leading the team that created the
              first computer language compiler, which led to the popular COBOL language. She resumed active naval service at
              the age of 60,
              becoming a rear admiral before retiring in 1986. Hopper died in Virginia in 1992.<a href="https://www.biography.com/people/grace-hopper-21406809" target="_blank">...Read More</a>

            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>Born Grace Brewster Murray in New York City on December 9, 1906, Grace Hopper studied math and physics at
              Vassar College. After graduating from Vassar in 1928, she proceeded to Yale University, where, in 1930,
              she received a master's degree in mathematics. That same year, she married Vincent Foster Hopper, becoming
              Grace Hopper (a name that she kept even after the couple's 1945 divorce). Starting in 1931, Hopper began
              teaching at Vassar while also continuing to study at Yale, where she earned a Ph.D. in mathematics in
              1934â€”becoming one of the first few woman to earn such a degree.<a href="https://www.biography.com/people/grace-hopper-21406809" target="_blank">...Read More</a>

          <h3>Career in Computing</h3>
          <p>Wanting to continue to work with computers, Hopper moved into private industry in 1949, first with the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation, then with Remington Rand, where she oversaw programming for the UNIVAC computer. In 1952, her team created the first compiler for computer languages (a compiler renders worded instructions into code that can be read by computers). This compiler was a precursor for the Common Business Oriented Language, or COBOL, a widely adapted language that would be used around the world.<a href="https://www.biography.com/people/grace-hopper-21406809" target="_blank">...Read More</a>
