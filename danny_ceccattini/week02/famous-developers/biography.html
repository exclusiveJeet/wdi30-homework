    <h1 class='bio.title'>THE LIFE OF LOVELACE</h1>
      <div class="bio-content">
        <p class="bio-text">Despite her name, she was at all loved by her parents, since her father Lord Byron was expecting a "glorious boy". She never got to know her father as he left home shortly after the birth, and died at age 34 when Ada was 8. Her mother, still bitter about the separation, took it out on Ada, and neglected Ada most of her life, referring to her as 'it'. Ada would suffer from a plethora of chronix illnesses all her life.</p>

        <p class="bio-text">The lack of affection from her parents was without a doubt a blessing in disguise. As Ada was coming of age, she would find herself constantly surrounded by England's haute intelligentsia. Her private math tutor was Mary Somerville, later dubbed ‘the queen of science’. Through Somerville she would meet the great Charles Babbage, inventor of the ‘Analytical Engine’. It is this machine on which Ada Lovelace would build what is considered to be the first computer program. A program which would calculate the sequence of Bernoulli numbers.</p>

        <p class="bio-text">Despite this privileged upbringing, it was clear that the genius of Lovelace lay in the nature of her love for critical inquisition. That is, not only did she love mathematics and 'hard sciences', she understood the epistemological importance of general philosophy and metaphysics, stating that both are in essential in “exploring the unseen word around us”. In essence, she would consider synthesis of these two fields a <span>"poetical science"</span>. In fact, after her successful attempts at proto-programming, she would come to the realisation that the true potential of such automating mechanics.</p>
