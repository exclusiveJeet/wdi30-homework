    <p>Computer scientist and programmer Yukihiro Matsumoto released this
       language in late 1995. After discussions with a colleague they decided to
       name the new language after which red gem?</p>
    <p>Answer: Ruby Matsumoto wanted a language that was simple to write, truly
       object-oriented, able to handle exceptions to be able to run on all
       platforms. Ruby is the only one of the choices that is red in colour.</p>
    <p><strong>Cocktail Party Fact</strong></p>
    <p>A Ruby developer that went by the handle Why the Lucky Stiff (a.k.a. _why)
       built many of the tools people use to learn Ruby today. They are best known
       for their whimsy and accessibility, two things that most introductions to
       programming lack. A great example is <a href="http://poignant.guide/book/chapter-1.html" target="_blank">“why’s (Poignant) Guide to Ruby”</a>
       which is impossible to do justice to when describing. What other
       programming manual has cartoon foxes? It’s a major inspiration for us
       here at Skillcrush.</P>
    <p>In 2009 _why vanished from the Internet, erasing both his persona and his
       projects. The Ruby community scrambled to save what they could, attempting
       to reconstruct his now-famous legacy. You can read the story over on
       Slate – <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/03/ruby_ruby_on_rails_and__why_the_disappearance_of_one_of_the_world_s_most_beloved_computer_programmers_.single.html" target="_blank">Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and _why – The disappearance of one of the world’s most beloved computer programmers.</a>
