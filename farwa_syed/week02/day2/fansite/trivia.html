            <p>A renowned mathematician and computer science pioneer, Margaret is credited with having coined the term software engineering while developing the guidance and navigation system for the Apollo spacecraft as head of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory.
              Hamilton explains why she chose to call it software engineering:
              <span>“I fought to bring the software legitimacy so that it—and those building it—would be given its due respect and thus I began to use the term ‘software engineering’ to distinguish it from hardware and other kinds of engineering, yet treat each type of engineering as part of the overall systems engineering process. When I first started using this phrase, it was considered to be quite amusing. It was an ongoing joke for a long time. They liked to kid me about my radical ideas. Software eventually and necessarily gained the same respect as any other discipline,”</span> she said in a recent interview with the Spanish newspaper El Pais.
              Recently, Hamilton was a featured keynote speaker at the 40th International Conference on Software Engineering held in Gothenburg, Sweden, where on May 31 she delivered her address “The Language as a Software Engineer.”</p>
