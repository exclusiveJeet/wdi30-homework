      <p class ="p">Wall is the developer of the Perl programming language. Wall is also known as
        the original author of the rn Usenet software, and the nearly universally used patch.
        He has won the IOCCC twice, and was the recipient of the first Free Software Foundations
        award for the Advancement of Free Software in 1998.</br></br>

        Beyond his technical skills, Wall is known for his wit and often ironic sense of humor
        which he displays in the comments to his source code or on Usenet (e.g. "We all agree on the
        necessity of compromise. We just can't agree on when it's necessary to compromise")</br></br>

        Larry Wall is a trained linguist, which helped him with his book writing, as well as with the
        design of Perl. He is the co-author of Programming Perl (often referred to as the Camel Book),
        which is the definitive resource for Perl programmers. He has also edited the Perl Cookbook.
        All of the books that he has edited or co-written are publishedby O'Reilly.</br></br>

        Wall continues to oversee further development of Perl and serves as the Benevolent Dictator
        for Life of the Perl project.</p>
